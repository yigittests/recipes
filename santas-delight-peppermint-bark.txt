Ingredients:
 - 1 pound vanilla-flavored candy coating
 - 3/4 cup crushed candy canes (about 5 ounces total) or crushed striped round peppermint candies (about 5 ounces or 28 candies)

Directions:
1. Line a cookie sheet with some waxed paper and set aside.
2. In a large microwave-safe bowl, place candy coating. Heat, uncovered, on 100 percent power (high) for 4 to 6 minutes, stirring every minute until soft enough to stir smooth. (Or, in a large saucepan, heat candy coating over low heat until melted, stirring constantly.)
3. Stir in peppermint candy (if you like, reserve 1/4 cup to sprinkle on top). Spread onto cookie sheet. Cool; break into pieces. Makes 1 pound (16 pieces).
